# ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD): Autonomous Day Trading Agent

## 1. Overview

### Goal
Develop an AI-powered Day Trading Agent that autonomously:
- Monitors live market data in real time,
- Applies predictive modeling based on historical patterns,
- Selects optimal trades,
- Submits trades via a brokerage API,
- Maximizes profit while managing risk.

### Target Users
- Individual day traders  
- Quant funds and algorithmic trading firms  
- Retail investors with brokerage API access

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Sources**:
  - Real-time price feeds (e.g., Nasdaq, NYSE, Polygon.io, Alpha Vantage)
  - Historical OHLCV data
  - Economic indicators and earnings reports
  - News sentiment *(optional v1.1 feature)*
- **Frequency**:
  - Real-time (sub-second latency)
  - Historical: daily, intraday (1-min, 5-min, 15-min bars)

### 2.2. Predictive Modeling Engine
- **Techniques**:
  - Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
  - ML models: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, LSTM for sequence prediction
  - Reinforcement Learning for strategy optimization
- **Signals Considered**:
  - Moving averages, RSI, MACD, volume spikes
  - Momentum indicators and reversal patterns
  - Volatility and correlation metrics

### 2.3. Trade Decision System
- **Strategy Types**:
  - Momentum-based trading
  - Mean reversion
  - Breakout trading
  - Risk-adjusted expected return maximization
- **Constraints**:
  - Risk tolerance thresholds (max loss per trade, max daily drawdown)
  - Position sizing (e.g., Kelly Criterion or fixed-fractional)
  - Maximum open positions
  - Sector exposure limits

### 2.4. Execution Layer
- **Broker API Integration**:
  - Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, Robinhood (examples)
  - API functions: Order submission, status tracking, cancellations
- **Order Types**:
  - Market, Limit, Stop-Limit
- **Fail-safes**:
  - Daily circuit breaker (halts if loss > X%)
  - Order retry/resubmit on failure
  - Full audit log of trades and model decisions
